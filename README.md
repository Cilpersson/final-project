# Photo grid ~ _community platform for image sharing_ ~

## What is this?

This is the final project I created during the Technigo boot camp. It is a platform for sharing memories with images using "grid pages", users connect to grid pages with the help of links or create their own grid page and share it with others. Each grid page has a guest book section.

For further reading head over to the [Project reflections](https://www.photogrid.community/ProjectReflections) on the site, where I have written both technical and personal reflections regarding this project.

**Clone it and:**

`cd frontend` => `npm install` => `npm start`

`cd backend` => `npm install` => `npm run dev`
